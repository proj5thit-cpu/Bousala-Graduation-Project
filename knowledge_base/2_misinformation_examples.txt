Examples of Misinformation During Conflicts

1. In Sudan (2023â€“2024), several false reports circulated about ceasefires that never took place, creating confusion and endangering civilians.
2. Fake images and videos from other countries (e.g., Syria, Yemen) were shared as if they were from Sudan.
3. Propaganda campaigns used fake social media accounts to spread false claims about safe areas, leading civilians into dangerous zones.
4. In health crises, misinformation about vaccines and disease outbreaks misled communities, causing mistrust in humanitarian aid.
