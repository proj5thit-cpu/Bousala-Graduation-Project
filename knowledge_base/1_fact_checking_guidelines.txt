Fact-Checking Guidelines for Civilians

1. Always verify information before sharing. Cross-check with at least two trusted sources (e.g., UN OCHA, WHO, BBC, Africa Check).
2. Watch for misleading signals: headlines in ALL CAPS, urgent tones, emotional wording, or statistics without references.
3. Use reverse image search to confirm if a photo is old or taken from another conflict.
4. Be cautious of anonymous social media accounts spreading alarming news without sources.
5. When in doubt, do not forward or share information until it is verified.
