# Sudan Conflict Context

- Since April 2023, Sudan has faced an armed conflict mainly between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
- Millions of civilians have been displaced, and misinformation has played a critical role in shaping public opinion and influencing civilian movement.
- False ceasefire announcements, fabricated humanitarian access updates, and manipulated social media campaigns have worsened the crisis.
- Trusted humanitarian organizations (e.g., UN OCHA, WHO, UNICEF, Sudanese Red Crescent) provide verified updates that civilians should rely on.
