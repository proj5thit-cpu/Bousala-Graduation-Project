Humanitarian Decision-Support Guidelines

1. When receiving unverified alerts (e.g., about attacks, shortages, or evacuations), civilians should first check trusted sources such as UN OCHA Sudan or WHO Sudan.
2. If official confirmation is unavailable, delay decisions that put lives at risk until more reliable information is obtained.
3. Use verified hotlines or contact humanitarian organizations before relocating to “safe zones.”
4. During health emergencies, rely only on WHO or Sudanese Ministry of Health announcements for guidance on treatment and prevention.
